# Car-Brand-Detector
Toy project on detecting car brands using public datasets. Start with simple models like CNN, ResNet, both training on scratch, and finetuning pretrained models.  


## Data 
The data is [Stanford Car dataset from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tanganke/stanford_cars). This is pretty old dataset with 8000+ training and testing images for 100 classes.
